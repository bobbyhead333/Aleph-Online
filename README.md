# To get started here,

- Make a folder.  
- Next, name that folder your github username.  
- Inside this folder, create a .readme and submit your assets that appear in Aleph - organize them how you like (but since this is what people will SEE, it reflects best on you to do so cleanly. 

You're done! :)
