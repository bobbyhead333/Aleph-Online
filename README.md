About:
We are a student team working remotely from all over the world to produce an explorable virtual reality multiplayer game (that can also be run "pancake mode") and seek to build our game design skills, prospects, and interests as we go along.  Our game design document ("GDD") can be found here:

# BRANCHES
* The main branch is the actual public release.
    - This is accessible to everyone and everyone and is what we would recommend to you to look at if you look at anything.  This stuff is the most tested and the most stable out of anything we produce.
- The development branch is what people directly upload their changes to (i.e. their 'assignments')
    - This branch is accessible to the root team (collaborators).  They will be given tasks, either as a team or as individuals, to fulfill.  Upon completion, they push their work to this branch, where everyone's simultaneously created work will be meshed together and, once smoothed some, pushed to the production branch.
* The production branch is us accumulating it all, and combing it to fix bugs and compatibility errors
    - The production branch is where the bugs will be sought out and fixed, and last-minute edits may be made to the game.  Once it's all smoothed out, the project is pushed to the main branch as the main, current version.
- The hotfix branch is to rapidly handle important bugs
    - Just in case we made a really bad decision, messed something up, didn't realize something was broke, or some other DEFCON 1 worthy crisis occurs, we will create this branch to resolve the issue ASAP.
* The assets branch is the aforementioned system we know about where you have a folder with your name on it, and under it, all the additions you gave to the project and your accreditations
    - Once you submit assets or some other form of work - we owe you credits!! DO NOT LET US SKIP THIS PART! You are responsible for uploading what you want to be publicly known as yours here.  3D Models, code, anything you made that appears in the project.  This branch has a folder for each person who has ever contributed, and under their named folder, a readme file with their accreditations and notes from others, and the compilation of all the assets they've created and chosen to show in this pseudo-portfolio folder, whose purpose is to advertise our great team members' strengths and achievements!
